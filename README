A template for making a "Submit Email for Download" facebook tab.

demo:  http://dev.org.org/FBemail2download/

Change vars in index.php and download.php

Uses sessions to remember if the user has submitted their email or not.
A user that uses the download link with out a session will be redirected
to the main page.

May need to change permissions on the 'emails.csv' file so its writeable.

File to be downloaded should be placed in a htpasswd protected folder for added security.
